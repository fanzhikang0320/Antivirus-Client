        <div class="content">
          <p>This Privacy Policy forms an integral part of the Site's Terms of Use (the "Terms"), a copy of which can be viewed at: Terms Of Use. Any capitalized term in this Privacy Policy that we don't define, will have the meaning given to it in the Terms.</p>

        <h4 class="little-title">2. Information We Collect</h4>
        <div class="content">
          <p> When you visit the Site, or use the Services, we may collect certain information about your visit and usage of the Site and the Services, in one or more of the following ways:</p>
          <p>a. Third Party Forms and Services: The Site lists, rates and compares various 3rd party businesses, brands and commercial entities (collectively, "Partners") and their respective products and/or services (collectively, "Products"). We may, from time to time, provide you with offers, services and Products of Partners via an online form to be filled out by you, upon your choice and consent, and such information will be used to facilitate your connection and/or engagement with the relevant Partner (“Lead”). Additionally, if you want to receive more information about a Partner or a Product, or if you otherwise want to pursue a transaction with a Partner, and you click the relevant Partner icon or tab, you may be directed to a landing page or an online form that is owned and operated by the Partner (the "Landing Page"); similarly, you may also be directed to the Landing Page through other websites and online searches. In either case, however, you may be prompted to submit certain information on the Landing Page, including Personal Information such as your name, email address, and phone number (such information collectively, "Landing Page Info"). The Landing Page Info that you submit is collected directly by the Partner who provided it, and will include its own privacy policy and data collection practices information. We advise you to refer to such privacy policies to better understand the purpose of collection and use of the Personal Information you submit.</p>
          <p>b. Contact Us. If you send us a ‘Contact Us’ (or similar) request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available, by sending an email to an email address that we display, by using a feedback or reporting feature that is available on the Site, or by other means, you may be required to provide us with certain Personal Information, such as your name and email address. Such information, including the content of your approach, will be used for the purposes of processing and addressing your request and for our legitimate business purposes, as further described in section 4 and 5 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>c.	Blogs, Newsletters, Surveys and Promotions. The Site may contain a blog forum, reviews, and articles displaying information about our services, Partners, Products, and the relevant market vertical. The Site may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to newsletters and participate in surveys and other promotional activities (some of which may be administered by us, and some of which may be administered by third party services with which we engage). In each of the foregoing cases, your interaction (such as responding on the blog forum, subscribing to a newsletter, or participating in a survey) may require you to provide certain Personal Information such as your name and email address. In which case, your submission of information will also be provided directly to such third party and will be used according to this privacy policy as well as such third party’s own privacy policy, and for the purpose for which you provided the information.</p>
          <p>d.	Device Information: For delivering and compatibility purposes, so as for language, geographic location and time zone, we collect device information such as: device type and version, operating system type, language and version, and information that can be extracted out of a user agent, such as browser type and version, and screen resolution.</p>
          <p>e.	Interactions and Usage: In order to provide the Services, operate the Site, and keep improving it, so as to be able to sync with our Partners and affiliates, we collect information about your interaction and use of the Services, such as: URL’s from which you were directed to the Site and to which you are referred from the Site, internal URL’s of the Site in which you visited and your actions with respect to the Services (such as view or click), date/time stamp of Site use, timing for clicks and page-views.</p>
          <p>f.	Log Files: We collect information through server log files, but also by deploying tracking technologies within the Site, such as pixel tags. We do this to analyze trends, track user’s engagement and interaction with the Site and respective Services. The type of information collected may include internet protocol (IP) addresses that your Internet Service Provider allocated to your device. We collect IP for a limited time and for specific purposes. First, to better understand your geographic location (country, region and language) and therefore be able to provide the Services in your own language and relevant to your place of origin. Second, we use automated tools to analyze IP addresses and flag those that are fraudulent (“Anti-Fraud Purposes”).</p>
          <p>g.	Cookies and Similar Technologies. The Site may use "cookies" and other anonymous web tracking technologies (such as "web beacons" and "pixel tags") implemented by us or by third party service providers. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store your online preferences and other information about the interaction you make in the Site. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your browser. However, some features or services, included in the Site, may not function properly without cookies, and some features may become unavailable for you in such cases. A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed (if applicable), and is often used in combination with cookies.</p>
          <p>Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more information about the type of cookies used and the manner in which we use cookies/tracking technologies on our Site.</p>
          <p>h.	Information We Receive from Third Parties. Like many Internet based services, the Site and the Services are operated and provided in collaboration, synchronization and interaction with third parties, including Partners, affiliates and other third parties. In order to enable and facilitate such synchronization, we may receive information from third parties, such as: an internal user identifier that our system generates to each user (not a unique identifier), and the summary of action taken by you (click, purchase, view, form submission or a phone call). In some Sites, you will be able – upon your choice – to consume the Service on a click-by-call basis. In which case, a third party vendor/s facilitates the call transmission, tracking and feedback for success. In such cases, the phone number from which you called may be provided to us (with no other information about you attached), for a limited time and for purposes of resolving referrals and successful calls with our Partners. Except for this purpose, we do not make any other use of such information, unless you give us your explicit consent.</p>

        <h4 class="little-title">5. Sharing Your Information with Third Parties.</h4>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We do not share Personal Information about you with Third Parties, except for the following circumstances:</p>
          <p>a.	Data Storage and Security Platforms (“Data Platforms”); We use third party cloud and storage services to store and retain your Information. It means that we send or otherwise share your Information to/with third party entities that are located anywhere in the world, including in the US, for the purpose of storing such information on our behalf, or for other processing needs. Such entities include Amazon Web Services (whose privacy policy is available at: https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/) which is Privacy Shield certified (further details of which can be found here). These Data Platforms may be located anywhere in the world. We use Data Platforms that maintain strict privacy protection and data security policies, and strict compliance with applicable data protection laws. However, their practices and activities are fully governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
          <p>b.	Social Media Platforms. We may share non identified information with social media platforms (such as Facebook, LinkedIn etc.) for marketing and operation purposes. Such social media platforms may collect your Personal Information independently and may combine the not identified information provided by us with your Personal Information which they collect, and to which you gave your separate and independent consent. Any such action and any Personal Information that may derive from it is subject to the social media's own privacy policy and is not governed, controlled or known by us.</p>
          <p>c.	Other Third Parties. We may send or otherwise share your Information to/with various third parties that help us with our business operations (for example, customer service operators and email or phone administration providers), that help us understand how our users use the Site and Services, operate them and to improve them. These third parties may have their own privacy policies that they adhere to, and we require them to make it available whenever their services are provided. We recommend you revisit such privacy policies when those Third Parties render their services directly to you. Also, these third parties may be based (and their servers may be located) anywhere in the world.</p>
          <p>d.	Enforcement. We may share your Personal Information with any third party if we believe that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) enforce our Terms of Use, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; and/or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Moonshot Marketing, our affiliated entities, our users, yourself, and/or the public.</p>

In which case, we may send your Online Form information or otherwise share it to/with the Partner about whom (or about whose Product) you wanted to receive more information or with which you have expressed interest in pursuing a transaction (the "Corresponding Partner" and "Corresponding Product", respectively), for such Corresponding Partner to contact you back with the information you have requested. If your submission of an Online Form information was not in respect of a specific Partner or Product that you clicked through, then we may send or otherwise share your Online Forms information to a Partner that provides services or products similar in nature to your request. In either case, you acknowledge that: (a) the Partners may contact you using the Online Form information which you submitted; (b) we do not control the way in which a Partner may contact you, or the subject matter of such contact; and (c) each Partner is required to provide its own privacy policy, and so it would not necessarily adhere to this Privacy Policy ; and (d) Partners may be based (and their servers may be located) anywhere in the world.</p>
          <p>f.

        <div class="content">
          <p>We, and respective third party services/affiliate entities implement data security systems and procedures to secure the information transmitted, processed and stored on the Site, our computer servers and systems. For example, the site is encrypted by using SSL and so is any other information at transport. We periodically review our information and data collection practices to ensure constant monitoring, use third party processing and serving services that implement various information security standards and certifications, and we monitor and filter access to data when it comes to personnel in our organization. Such systems and procedures reduce the risk of security breaches, but they do not provide absolute security, as there is no such thing when it comes to the worldwide network. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the Site and our servers are immune to unauthorized access to the information stored therein and to other information security risks. </p>
